# Panda-Bears

Panda bears is a clicker game. It is programmed with usage of the SFML library with the C++ programming language. </br>
At the beginning of the game players have the possibility to input their name in the main menu options. </br>
If there is no such input the player name will be setted as NoName. In this game it is necessary to keep  </br>
the three pandas alive by feeding them, playing with them and giving them enough sleep. </br>
The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible without any of the panda bears dying. The longer you live, </br>
the higher your score is. The game ends with the death of any panda. After losing the score is displayed and a player  </br>
can go to the leaderboard located in the main menu to see which place he has. </br> </br>
